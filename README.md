# AegisLiveBot

This Discord bot is developed for ForgottenProject's Discord server. The current purpose of this Discord bot is to update the roles of streamers with a specified LIVE role to reflect that they are streaming. The Discord bot also priortizes certain streamers to that when they are streaming, only they will get the LIVE roles, rather than everyone registered for the role.

This is currently the ONLY Discord bot(unverfied) to implement the Tafl game, (or Tablut from Mount and Blade).

This Discord bot also implemented the Chess game and the Chinese Chess(象棋zoengkei) game.

The Discord bot can be developed into a general purpose bot depending on need, there is currently no plan to turn this into a public bot, but interested individuals can download the bot and host it on their own server.

Instructions on how to do so will be made available on request.
